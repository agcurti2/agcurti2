    <!-- <p>In this work, I investigated a collective swarm behavior: shape formation.
      Traditional shape formation algorithms assume robots have enough energy to form the shape, then the algorithms terminate once the shape is formed.
      This presents limitations to practical applications as the shape can only exist for as long as the energy duration of individual robots, and the shape formation
      is not adaptable to changes in the environment or human-initiated formation changes. -->
    <p>
      In this work, I develop a set of distributed control algorithms to facilitate swarm shape formation that is <strong>persistent</strong>,
      meaning the shapes can last beyond the energy duration of individual robots, and <strong>adaptable</strong> to formation changes in real time.
      The idea is that a swarm can persist in a shape perpetually, and then that shape can be sculpted into a new shape by a human in the same way an artist may sculpt clay.

    <h2>Shape Persistence <a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top ↑</a></h2>
    <p>
      Shape persistence is achieved by finding Hamiltonian cycles through 2D shapes so that robots can follow a Hamiltonian path
      through a shape that both approximates the shape and moves robots through the shape in a first-in-first-out order.
      This means that robots are guaranteed to enter the shape, travel through the shape without collision, and then exit the shape 
      so that they can return to a charging station.
      Therefore, individual robots are continuously recharging and reentering the shape, while the swarm maintains the shape as a whole persistently and indefinitely.
      In the paper, it is proven that a Hamiltonian cycle can be found for any valid, continuous 2D shape.

    <h2>Shape Adaptability <a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top ↑</a></h2>
    <p>
      Shape adaptability is achieved by detecting the change (in this case a human gesture), filling in a new part of the shape (or removing a part of the shape),
      and then finding a new Hamiltonian cycle through the new shape. Finding the new Hamiltonian cycle is done using a mix of robot motion and peer-to-peer communication.
      Like shape persistence, it can be proven that a new Hamiltonian cycle can be found for any valid addition or any valid subtraction to the 2D shape.

    <h2>Demonstration <a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top ↑</a></h2>
    <p>
      The 2D shape formation algorithms were demonstrated on a swarm of differential drive ground robots called Coachbots. 
      The swarm maintained a shape in the middle of the arena while cycling robots to a charging rail at the edge of the arena.

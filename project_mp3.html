    <p>Maneuverable Piccolissimo 3 (MP3), shown above, is also a single-rotor flyer that spins in flight. It is an iterative improvement on the Maneuverable Piccolissimo 2 (MP2), and it was
      developed to demonstrate peer-to-peer communication and localization.
      In this generation of flyer, the structured light from MP2s environment was removed and replaced by transmission LEDs at the center of each MP3.
      For the sake of demonstration only, we also built stationary beacons with identical transmission LEDs to mimic more MP3s (without the added cost of building more MP3s).
      Each MP3 was also equipped with three photodiodes for detecting the structured light emitted from other MP3s and beacons.
      The photodiodes complete a scan of MP3's environment with each flyer rotation which
      allows each MP3 to triangulate its x,y,z position and yaw orientation with respect to its neighboring MP3s.
      The PID-based controller from MP2 was then implemented on MP3 for precise controlled flight in station keeping and step response.

    <p>I am a sixth year Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. candidate at the Center for Robotics and Biosystems (CRB)
        at Northwestern University. I strive to be a technical thought leader investigating solutions to important
        problems in science and engineering. I am specifically interested in the design and control of resource limited
        robots, and solving the engineering challenges associated with the development, deployment, and continuous operation 
        of robotic swarms. For robots and robotic swarms to be practical, they must operate with limited
        resouces, for extended durations, and in environments shared with humans. In my research, I am working to solve many of these problems
        so that humans and robotic swarms can operate seamlessly to accomplish long duration tasks from agricultural monitoring and 
        disaster response to entertainment and collective construction.

        This website highlights five of my major projects. The first two, MP2 and MP3, describe the design of two single-rotor
        flying vehicles modeled after the original Maneuverable Piccolissimo (MP). These projects serve as proof that 
        flyers can be inexpensive with minimalistic designs and still achieve controlled flight with onboard sensing and localization.
        The 2D Shape Formation project explores a collective swarm behavior (forming a shape) while taking into account the 
        limited energy resources onboard each robot and the need for the swarm to react to a human.
        The 3D Shape Formation project explores similar concepts as its 2D counterpart, but in 3D.
        Finally, the Quadrotor Swarm project describes a 50 robot flying swarm designed, built, and deployed from scratch. 
        The 3D Shape Formation project was demonstrated on this swarm.
